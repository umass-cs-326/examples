<!-- HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML
consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different
parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The
enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can
italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. -->

<!-- The DOCTYPE In HTML, the doctype is the required "<!DOCTYPE html>" preamble
found at the top of all documents. Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from
switching into so-called “quirks mode” when rendering a document -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The <html> tag is the "root" element. It wraps all the content of the
entire page. -->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- The <head> element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to
include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's
viewers.-->
  <head>
    <!-- This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in
    the browser tab the page is loaded in. -->
    <title>01 HTML</title>

    <!-- Other stuff goes in here like <script> tags and <style> tags, as we
      we will see when we get to CSS. -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- The <body> contains all the content that you want to show to web users
    when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games,
    playable audio tracks, or whatever else. -->
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
